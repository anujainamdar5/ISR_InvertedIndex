LIFE IS BEAUTIFUL. ONE DAY, ONE HOUR AND ONE MINUTE, WILL NOT COME AGAIN IN YOUR ENTIRE LIFE. AVOID FIGHTS, ANGRINESS AND SPEAK LOVELY TO EVERY PERSON. THE SMILE ON MY FACE DOESN'T MEAN MY LIFE IS PERFECT. IT MEANS I APPRECIATE WHAT I HAVE AND WHAT GOD HAS BLESSED ME WITH. THE SUN NEVER STOPS SHINING.
